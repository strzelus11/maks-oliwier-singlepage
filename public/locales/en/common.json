	"Tutoring1": "In teaching physics and mathematics, we place particular emphasis on “insight” or deep understanding. This makes remembering formulas or rules no problem at all. A good example is Planck’s distribution formula:",
	"Tutoring2": "I remember when I couldn’t recall it at all—it was truly a bit challenging! But now, when I see the free photon gas density states, photon energy, and Bose-Einstein distribution, the formula becomes totally familiar. That’s the power of insight: it lets you solve problems in your head while others reach for calculators."
